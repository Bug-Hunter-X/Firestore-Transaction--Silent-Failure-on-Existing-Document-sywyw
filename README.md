# Firestore Transaction Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Firebase Firestore transactions where an attempt to create a document that already exists fails silently.  The provided code attempts to create a new document using a transaction, but it doesn't properly handle the case where the document already exists. This leads to unexpected behavior and makes debugging difficult because no error is thrown.

The solution shows how to correctly handle existing documents within a Firestore transaction using a try-catch block and providing explicit error handling.
